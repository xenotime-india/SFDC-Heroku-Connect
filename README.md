# SFDC-Heroku Connect

* [Live Demo](https://sfdc-heroku-connect-xenotime.herokuapp.com/)

## Quick Setup

### Scaffolding

1. At the root of this repo, execute `docker-compose up`
1. Once you see your container running as indicated by the message `LOG: database system is ready to accept connections`
1. To stop all the code and infrastructure, press Ctrl + C from this terminal
1. To delete all of the infrastructure and start from scratch, at the root of this repo, execute `docker-compose down && ./docker_clean.sh && docker-compose up`

### Web API

1. Open a terminal and execute `./docker_bash.sh` to open a bash into the container
1. Execute `yarn run develop:api` in the bash of the container
1. Open `http://localhost:64003/api/hello?name=me` in a browser for the Web API
   * **Note**: Any changes in `api` will reflect in your Docker container automatically thanks to Nodemon
1. To debug the Web API, attach your favorite Node Editor/IDE's debugger to `localhost:64004`

### Web Client

1. Open a terminal and execute `./docker_bash.sh` to open a bash into the container
1. Execute `yarn run develop:client` in the bash of the container
1. Open `http://localhost:64002` for the `create-react-app` dev server

### Swagger Project Editor

1. Open a terminal and execute `./docker_bash.sh` to open a bash into the container
1. Execute `yarn run swagger:edit` in the bash of the container
1. Open `http://localhost:64005` for the Swagger Project Editor

### NPM Tasks

* **yarn run develop:api**: Executes Nodemon (exposing Node Debugger to the container's port 5858) of your server code
* **yarn run develop:client**: Starts the create-react-app dev server with Redux Debugging enabled
* **yarn run swagger:edit**: Runs Swagger Project Editor on the container's port 3002
* **yarn test**: Single run of Jest on any `*.test.js* unit test file
* **yarn run test:watch**: Runs an ongoing, live reloading Jest test watcher for any `*.test.js` unit test file

### Adding New Dependencies

Your container is the source of your code going forward.  While it has a localized `node_modules` on both server and client to prevent platform-specific compilation problems (with things like `bcrypt`), you can still manage dependencies within and it will reflect on your local `package.json`.

To do this, you simply need to bash into the container by executing: `./docker_bash.sh`.  This will open a terminal in the container running your code.  You can then add dependencies as normal, using `yarn add some_library`.

Note that you can execute this command in multiple _local_ terminals to achieve the same effect as having multiple bash terminals in a pure local setup.

To exit from the container's bash, simply execute `exit`

### Prettier

This scaffold comes with a `prettier` precommit Git hook.  In other words, your JS can be in whatever style you want as you develop.  When you stage your commits to git, `prettier` will automatically format your code to an opinionated standard.

## Troubleshooting

### ENOSPC Issues With Docker

If you are doing heavy development in Docker and aren't actively removing volumes, you might run into an ENOSPC problem when you execute `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up`.  

To alleviate this, execute `./docker_clean.sh` in a Terminal then attempt to do another `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up`.

This command deletes and "dangling" volumes and images -- that is, any volumes or images that are orphaned because of prior `docker-compose build` or container removals.
